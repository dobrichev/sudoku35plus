# sudoku35plus
A command line tool that reads sudoku 9x9 puzzles with 35 or more givens, converts them to 35-given subgrids by removing the givens in all possible ways, and adds additional givens in all possible ways until single-solution puzzle with no redundant clues is generated.

Supported OS: 64-bit Linux, 64-bit Windows.

An earlier version of tool was used in discovery of the 40-clue minimal sudoku puzzles.
